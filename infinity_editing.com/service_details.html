            <p>Editing involves actively amending your writing to improve it. Standard Editing includes the Proofreading Service plus editing at the sentence-level to improve sentence structure, readability, clarity, and consistency (of tense, tone, voice, etc.). We will also ensure that the English usage is accurate, coherent and concise. The editor might make comments and suggestions to alert the author to any concerns or to seek clarification about meaning; thus, the author should be prepared to correspond with the editor to ensure timely completion of the work. This service includes a free follow-up edit before resubmission of the original document (for example, after review), in accordance with our <a href="terms.html"  target="_blank" class="external-link">Terms of Service</a> (opens in new tab). This is our most popular service and is used to expedite writing projects. This is also a popular choice amongst scientists for whom English is not a first language.</p>

            <p>Premium Editing includes our Proofreading and Standard Editing Services plus more substantial editing at the paragraph, section and whole document level. We may need to re-word or re-write sentences, reorganise disjointed paragraphs, move the order of paragraphs, and alter the composition of the document as a whole to improve comprehension and the flow of ideas. It may be necessary to reduce word count and we may need to discuss content with you. Thus, this service will likely involve close collaboration between the editor and client to ensure that content is accurate and the message and meaning are clear. The result will be improved composition and style, and a document that is easy to read and understand. This service includes a free follow-up edit for resubmissions in accordance with our Terms of Service (opens in new tab) as well as free formatting to a journal house-style. This service is also suitable if a large reduction in word count is required or if a reviewer has already advised you to seek an editing service.

Proofreading and Standard Editing does not include formatting to journal guidelines, although this is available as an additional service. If you have not chosen this service, we will edit and format to what we consider a 'normal' document format. Note, though, that some journals have their own house-style, resulting in subtle differences in English usage between journals, but these are normally a concern only for the copy-editor after acceptance for publication. </p>

However, the accuracy of both illustration and data visualisation depends on the information supplied to us by the client. Any errors on our part will be corrected free of charge, but alterations needed because of errors or omissions that originate from the client, or a change of mind by the client, may be subject to additional charges. Likewise, if substantial alterations are requested by the client after the work has begun, these may incur an additional charge. </p>
            <p>Images can be delivered in scalable vector graphics (.svg) format as well raster-based/bitmap formats of your choosing (.jpeg, .png, .gif, .tiff, etc.). Scalable vector graphics allow you to re-size an image without loss of quality or pixelation, but require software that can use this format. Some types of image may not be amenable to vector graphics, in which case raster-based imaging will be used. Please ask us if you are not sure about this.</p>

        <p>If you commission illustration, data visualisation or animation you will pay the full fee for the work and copyright will be transferred to you (you will become the copyright owner). This is particularly important if you need to transfer the copyright to a third party, like a publisher, if the work is to appear in a journal or similar outlet.</p>
        <p>Licensing illustration, data visualisation or animation is normally cheaper than commissioning, but means that you do not own copyright. Rather, you are granted permitted usage under the License Agreement. In this case, you will not be able to use the image if transfer of copyright is needed or for use outside of the terms of the license. In particular, you will not be allowed to share, disseminate or distribute the work outside of that specified in the License Agreement, and you will not be allowed to sell or publish the work in copyrighted material or transfer ownership. Licenses usually have an expiry date. Each license will be customised for you according to your intended use, size of distribution and geographical area (e.g., worldwide distribution). For example, licensing may restrict use to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Personal use - for non-commercial use, for example, personal prints and reference</li>
        <li>Presentations - for use in live, unrecorded presentations in Powerpoint or Keynote software etc.</li>
        <li>Newsletters - for use in printed or digital in-house newsletters</li>
        <li>Annual reports - for use in printed or digital annual reports</li>
        <li>Website - for use on a single website, app, social media post or blog</li>
        <li>Magazines - for use in a single printed or digital magazine; the license may vary by the size of circulation</li>
        <li>Books - for use in a single printed or digital book; the license may vary by the size of the print-run or circulation</li>
        <li>Marketing packages - for use in a single marketing campaign that promotes a business or product, but may exclude advertising</li>
        <li>Advertising - for use in adverts within the specified media</li>
        <li>Royalty-free licensing is more expensive, but means that images can be used across multiple projects without the need to purchase additional licenses.</li>
        <li>Copying or editing the original image to pass off as your own constitutes a breach of copyright law. </li>
        <li>Please note that the licensing terms and the License Agreement will be included with any visual or audio asset, including images, illustration, animation, audio or video, that we supply to you.</li>
