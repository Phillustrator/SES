<h4>3.1 Service and Fee</h4>
  <p>The Service and fee will be specified on the Quote. If a Service is requested that We do not think will produce a satisfactory outcome, e.g., a Standard Editing Service is requested but a Premium Editing Service is needed, We will advise You and give Our reasons. We reserve the right to refuse a Service if We do not think that it will produce a satisfactory outcome for Us or You. Some Services and fees are dealt with on a case-by-case basis and the fee and Service will be specified on the Quote.</p>
<h4>3.2 Quote and Order Confirmation</h4> 
  <p>A written Quote for requested work will be provided for Your approval. Approval of the Quote represents Your Order Confirmation; You must approve the Quote, confirming Your order, before work can begin. Your approval and Order Confirmation constitute an instruction to us to undertake the work on Your behalf, for which You will be agreeing to pay the fee specified in the Total on the Quote. Your Order Confirmation also represents that You agree to, and are bound by, Our Terms of Service.</p> 
<h4>3.3 Word Count for Editing and Proofreading Services</h4>
  <p>The word count and corresponding fee will be included in the Quote, which You must approve before work commences. You will only be charged for the words that We edit. You can specify exactly what You would like Us to edit, but We will normally check and edit the words in the title, short-title, abstract/summary/lay summary, keywords, headings and sub-headings, the main body of the text, legends, and the headings of figures and tables. If You send Us supplementary materials, We will edit titles, headings and sub-headings, the main body of the text, legends, and the headings of figures and tables.</p>
  <p>If you send us a document with text that You do not wish to be edited, please state this when submitting Your documents (or redact the words in the documents). It is Your responsibility to make it clear to Us which words You would like Us to edit and which You would like Us to ignore.</p>
  <p>We do not edit title page content like author lists, affiliations and contact details. We do not edit or format references and citations, unless requested as an Additional Service (please contact Us about this). Text within the tables and figures is not edited, but this Service can be requested as an additional Service, subject to Our discretion and provision of relevant documents and materials by You.</p>
<h4>3.4 Payment</h4>
<h6>3.4.1 Normal Payment and Late Payment</h6>
<p>We will issue an invoice to You as soon as work commences. Payment of all fees is normally required before the completed work is made available to You. In some instances, and at Our discretion, payment can be made within 30-days of the work being returned to You. After 30-days, a late payment charge will be added to the invoice at 1.5% per month of the total invoice amount (Annual Percentage Rate of 18%). Payment should be made by bank transfer or credit card, as instructed on the invoice.
</p>
<p>Your Order Confirmation means that You agree that payment will be made in full and without off-set, counter-claim or withholding of any kind and in the currency specified in the Quote.
</p>
<p>It is Your responsibility to provide Us with complete and accurate billing and contact information and to notify Us of changes to any such information.
</p>
<p>If there are errors on the invoice, You should notify Us the moment that You become aware of such errors and We will re-issue the invoice forthwith. In the case where You have overpaid because of an invoice error, We will refund You the difference or credit Your balance to this amount upon Your instruction. We are not liable for any fees, accruals or interest on the overpaid amount.
</p>
<p>If You wish to dispute an amount invoiced by Us, You should, within one month of the invoice date, provide Us with the evidence that demonstrates that a specific charge is incorrect and make a good faith request to Us to investigate the specific charge. Upon receipt of such a request from You, We will investigate the matter in a reasonable and appropriate way, given the circumstances of the dispute. When these investigations are concluded, You agree to pay any outstanding amount within five Working Days. If no such good faith request is made, You accept that the invoice is valid and agree to pay the amount specified on the invoice as per these Terms of Service.
</p>
<h6>3.4.2 Advanced Payment</h6>
<p>We accept advance payment and deposit of funds for future work. In this case the balance of the invoice will be deducted from the balance of the advance payment funds You have deposited with Us. We will notify You of the payment and the remaining balance of Your funds. 
</p>
<h6>3.4.3 Discounts and Special Offers:</h6>
<p>Discounts and Special Offers are made at Our discretion and will be specified on the Quote.
</p>
<h4>3.5 Time to Complete Work</h4>
<p>The time needed to complete the work will be specified in the Quote. Work will begin when the Quote is accepted by You, which constitutes Your Order Confirmation for Us to undertake the work on Your behalf, for which You agree to pay the fee specified in the Total included in the Quote. In some cases, however, this time will depend on You responding to Our queries. Whilst We will always endeavour to complete the work within the specified time, We may, at Our discretion, extend the time to completion if You have not provided useful and useable responses in a timely fashion or if a delay in Your response has prevented progress being made by Us. 
</p>
<p>Editing and Proofreading will normally be completed within 7 Working Days of work commencement, unless an expedited Service has been requested and agreed by Us. Where an expedited Service has been requested and agreed by Us, work will be completed within 4 working days (with a 20% additional charge) or 2 working days (with a 40% additional charge), as per Your request and as specified on the Quote. Expedited Services are normally only available for Proofreading and Standard Editing Services. Other Services may take longer and will be agreed prior to the commencement of work and will be specified on the Quote.
</p>
<h4>3.6 Delay, Cancellation and Refund</h4>
<p>We will do Our utmost to fulfil Our obligations to You and support Your work. However, We cannot be held responsible for delays caused by Your actions or by Force Majeure (sometimes called 'Acts of God'). Examples of Force Majeure include, but are not limited to: fire, earthquake, volcanic activity, flood, any other natural disaster, civil disturbance, industrial action or any other situation beyond Our control, like ill health, injury or death. In the case of a delay by Force Majeure, We will do Our utmost to notify You of the circumstances and this will entitle both You and Us to withdraw from the contract for the work. If, for any reason other than Your actions (see “Time to Complete Work”) or Force Majeure, work is delivered late, We will refund 5% of the total cost for each day the delivery date exceeds the completion date, but not exceeding the full amount on the Invoice.
</p>
<p>If the client cancels the work after approving the Quote, they will be obliged to pay for all the work completed up until the point that the work was cancelled, calculated on the basis of word count and/or pro-rata, depending on the nature of the work and at Our discretion. Cancellations will be accepted up to 24-hours before the deadline, after which the client will be liable to pay the invoice in full, as per the Quote.
</p>
<p>We aim to provide You with the best possible Service that We can. If You are unsatisfied or dissatisfied with the Service that we have provided, please contact Us immediately and submit an outline of the problems you are encountering with Our Service, and how We might put that right. We will take all reasonable steps to address the issue in a timely manner, including re-doing the work, amending the work, or, at Our discretion, refunding the fee in part or in whole. Please contact us no longer than one month from the date that the work was delivered to You.
</p>
<h4>3.7 Author Queries and Your Responsibility</h4>
<p>For Standard and Premium editing, Our editors may need to correspond with You to clarify meanings, ask questions and invite Your input into the editing process. We may ask You to check Our changes and provide Feedback. It may require that You make further amendments and return the work so that We can check and finish the work before submission. In this regard We will be collaborating with You to produce the best possible outcome. We ask that You allow time for this and respond to Our queries expediently so that We can finish the work as soon as possible and to the highest standard.
</p>
<h4>3.8 Fact-checking and Cross-referencing</h4>
<p>We cannot check the accuracy of Your measurements, the data You report, calculations, statistical analyses, statistical interpretation, accurate and fair citation, or the validity of the underlying theory or theories. If You have concerns about any of these aspects of Your work, Our consultation Service may be of assistance with some of these things, but journal publishers, conference organisers, funding organisations and other entities will ask that You accept responsibility for the factual accuracy of Your work before submission. We are not responsible for the factual accuracy of Your work and accept no liability in this regard. If We are concerned about the factual accuracy of what You have written, We will query this with You using the ‘comments’ function in Microsoft Word or by email. It is Your responsibility to read and act upon these comments. 
</p>
<p>We do not cross-reference data between tables, figures, text, abstract, appendices or supplementary materials, unless requested by You as an Additional Service. Where You request this Service, it will be agreed by Us at Our discretion and included in the Quote. 
</p>
<h4>3.9 Revision and Resubmission</h4>
<p>After a manuscript or funding proposal has been submitted for review and returned to You with reviewer comments, You may need to resubmit a revised manuscript. For Standard and Premium editing, We include one free edit of the revised original work specified in the Quote. This applies to a document that has not been changed more than 30% from the original (that is, is still recognisable as the original document). If changes to the original document exceed 30%, You should discuss this with Us to ensure We can help You in the most reasonable way (for example, the free edit cannot be applied to a completely new or different document). If substantial editing of the original document is needed (in excess of 30%), We can edit the new document at a discounted rate. For Premium Editing, if the first submission of a manuscript for publication in a journal is triaged or rejected outright (without review), editing of one de novo submission to a second journal is included free of charge, in addition to a free edit of a resubmission after review.
</p>
<p>The free edit is valid for 12-months from the date that the original work is completed and returned to You. Revisions will normally be completed within 7 working days of Us receiving the work from You, depending upon the extent of the work required. 
Proofreading or editing the ‘response to reviewer's comments’ (sometimes called the ‘rebuttal’) is not included in the Quote, but can be requested as an Additional Service and a Quote provided. In this case, the word count will not include any text that is quoted from the manuscript (as We will have checked this already).

To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and Service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or Services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.

        <p>To the extent permitted by law, the Company, its Services and the Website will not be liable for any indirect or consequential loss or damage whatsoever (including without limitation loss of business, opportunity, data, profits) arising out of or in connection with the use of the Website or Our Services. The Company makes no warranty that the Website or its Services will meet Your requirements, that Content will be accurate or reliable, that the functionality of the Website or Services will be uninterrupted or error free, that defects will be corrected or that the Website or Services or the server that makes them available are free of viruses or anything else which may be harmful or destructive.

        </p>
        <p>Nothing in these Terms and Conditions shall be construed so as to exclude or limit the liability of the Company for death or personal injury as a result of the negligence of the Company, its Services or the Website. Nothing in these Terms and Conditions shall affect Your statutory rights as a consumer. Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of these Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.

        </p>
        <p>In the United States, some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.
